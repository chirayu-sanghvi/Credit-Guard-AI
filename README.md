## Problem Statement 
 
The challenge of accurately predicting credit card defaults is a fundamental concern in 
consumer lending. The project aims to address this issue, by developing machine, 
learning models, capable of outperforming existing methods, thereby enhancing risk 
assessment practices and ultimately improving the learning experience for both financial 
institutions and customers. 
 
Background: 
 
Credit card default prediction is pivotal to the sound operation of consumer lending 
businesses. It determines whether the borrowers will repay their credit card balances 
promptly which, in turn, influences lending decisions, customer experiences and 
financial stability. Accurate prediction, mitigate risk, minimizes loss, and foster more 
efficient lending processes. The significance of this problem lies in its direct impact on 
the profitability, sustainability and customer satisfaction of lending institutions. Defaults 
can result in substantial financial losses and, in some cases even threaten the viability of 
these institutions. 
 
Potential Contributions: 
 
1. Optimize lending decisions: Enhanced predictive models enable lending institutions 
to make better informed decisions regarding credit approvals and lending limits. This 
contributes to improved risk management and reduced default rates. 
 
2. Improved customer experience: More accurate predictions can lead to fairer credit 
decisions, resulting in increased approval rates for credit card applications. This 
intern provides customers with greater access to financial services and smoother 
application process. 
 
3. Enhanced Financial Stability: Lower default rates and better risk management can 
have a direct positive impact on the financial stability of lending institutions. 
Reduced defaults translate into reduced losses and improved profitability. 
 
4. Foster Innovation: The development of advanced machine learning model 
encourages innovation within the lending industry. This projectâ€™s findings can inspire 
further research and technological advancements in credit risk assessment. 
 
5. Strengthen Industry competitiveness: Lending institutions that adopt more effective 
credit default prediction models gain a competitive edge in the market. This can lead 
to improve market share, and sustained growth.
